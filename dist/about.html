          <p>
            I have always had passion for building things and solving problems.
            My previous experience as a visual merchandiser, has given me a
            valuable perspective into how good and bad design affect people and
            choices they make.
          </p>
          <p>
            I enjoyed creating beautiful setups and displays but understanding
            the users, discovering and solving problems was something I was
            always very passionate about. Therefore, leading me to recently
            complete a 400+ hour UX Design course through CareerFoundry. I
            embrace all design problems with open-mind and thrive to find the
            best solutions by asking right questions and putting users first.
          </p>
          <p>
            My goal is to design products and experiences that puts users needs
            first,enriches peopleâ€™s lives and at the same time provides simple
            solutions to complex problems. Please take a look at my resume below
            to learn more about my skills and experience. If you are interested
            in the services I provide please do not hesitate to contact me. I am
            looking forward to hear from you.
