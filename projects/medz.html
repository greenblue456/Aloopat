        While Landing pages are so important, not every business use them.
        Landing page if done right is great opportunity to create conversions
        and build customer base.

      <p class="sectiontext">
        However its effectiveness hugely relies on the design decisions and
        there is a misconception that they are hard to create and maintain.
        Therefore, I wanted to test it out myself to see it it really was true.

        What makes a successful landing page?
      </p>

      <p class="sectiontext">
        Before I started designing I researched and analyzed several good
        landing pages that were featured on muzli, unbounce and hubspot.
      </p>
      <p class="sectiontext">
        Common patterns among all the landing page were:
      </p>

      <div class="sectiontext">
        <ul>
          <li>Clear conversion goal (e.g. getting a new user)</li>
          <li>
            Every component in this page contributed to support this goal.
          </li>
          <li>CTA (call-to-action) button stands out throughout the page</li>
          <li>Social proof/Testimonials or customer stories</li>
          <li>
            Answers to How/Why/ What - are you offering that solves my pain
            point or satisfies my desire?
          </li>
          <li>
            Easily readable and few and clear links to reduce distractions.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <h2 class="subsectionheading">Design Thinking</h2>
      <h3 class="subsectionheading">Empathize</h3>
      <p class="sectiontext">
        For a while now I have heard many people complaining about facing
        challenges to get a doctors appointment when they need. Its hard and
        sometimes impossible to find a good doctor especially if you are new to
        a place and more challenging if you can’t speak local language. I
        recently faced similar situation where I was sick and next available
        appointment was 2 months later. Leading me to think how great it would
        be to have an app to find quick alternative doctor.
      </p>
      <p class="sectiontext">
        Therefore, I decided to create (landing page for) a fictional medical
        app Medz which could help in solving these challenges to find right
        doctor
      </p>
      <h3 class="subsectionheading">Define</h3>
      <p class="sectiontext">
        As I already had few experience on this issue and also heard it from
        almost everyone around me, I did not feel the need to create a specific
        person for this project.
      </p>
      <h3 class="subsectionheading">Ideate and Prototype</h3>
      <p class="sectiontext">
        With all the collected information, I drew few versions of paper
        wireframes to capture my ideas. I tried to combine all the important
        elements from What makes a successful landing page?
      </p>

      <div class="twoboxgrid">
        <img src="../img/projects/medz/4.jpg" alt="" />
        <img src="../img/projects/medz/5.jpg" alt="" />
      </div>

      <h2 class="subsectionheading">High Fidelity Wireframe</h2>

      <p class="sectiontext">
        For landing page of Medz I decided to use currently trending
        illustration instead of photos to make the images easier to understand
        because it can break the rules of representation like that. “How it
        works” is often clearer when very abstracted as they need to show
        specific information.
      </p>
      <p class="sectiontext">
        As for the colours I wanted to use neutral, calm and relaxing
        colourtone. At the same time it had to be dependable, conservative, and
        flexible to represent Medz. Therefore beige with blue as secondary
        colour was selected.
      </p>

      <div class="grid-container1">
        <div class="leftside">
          <img class="image" src="../img/projects/medz/6.jpg" alt="" />
        </div>
        <div class="nested-grid-container1">
          <div class="nested">
            <p>
              First impression gets straight to the point with minimal
              distractions and clear CTA buttons including the app download
              options.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              In case the user is not convinced right away and need more
              information before using the CTA button, there is a permanent ‘Get
              started’ CTA button visible in the fixed positioned navigation
              bar. This way a CTA option is always visible during scrolling and
              discovering the content of the landing page.

              users are familiar with the brand and its services.

        Findings and Takeaways.
      </p>

      <p class="sectiontext">
        Designing a landing page was an excellent opportunity to think more
        deeply into this topic and experiment with different decisions that go
        into critical details as the placement of the CTA buttons. Although it
        is just a landing page, the strategy behind the creation is much more
        complicated than I’ve imagined. From page layout to copywriting to
        visual hierarchy, it really is a combination of UX and marketing.
      </p>
      <p p class="sectiontext">
        At this point, the landing page is far from complete, since, in case of
        a real project, this would be the starting point to develop and launch
        the page to measure the reactions and interactions of the users. Next
        steps would be then to use the numbers to further improve and optimize
        the design.
