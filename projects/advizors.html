        Since it was part of my CareerFoundry UX course, I was responsible for
        the overall strategy, the UX research, the information architecture,
        user testing & interaction design. I started the design from scratch,
        ending up creating an innovative working prototype with user experience
        as the core of my design.

          <p>
            The biggest challenge for me was to find a balance between, the
            nature of the app which required it to ooze professionalism. at the
            same time to create an app which was simple, playful and functional
            for the users.

      <div class="twoboxgrid">
        <div class="boxtext">
          <p>
            Design inspiration of this app came from wanting to create a
            platform for our users and experts which was professional and
            inviting. With Advizors mykey focus was to create a clean,
            trustworthy and user friendly application. Rather than creating an
            app that feels monotonous, I have regarded the best way to navigate
            and filter content on mobile devices.

        <p>Some of the key findings were</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            People tend to use the convenient resources like friends, family,
            networking and Internet before looking for expert help.
          </li>
          <li>
            Trust plays big role on their decisions when they need help or
            advice as all the users first turned to someone reliable for help
            before seeking out answer elsewhere.
          </li>
          <li>
            Users hated that the app was not interactive and engaging, and they
            lost the motive to use them after some time.
          </li>
          <li>
            All the users were willing to pay the experts for their time and
            effort, the two options were either to pay per session or using
            subscriptions.
          </li>
          <li>
            Users review was one of the key components that made experts
            trustworthy to the users. But at the same time certification,
            qualification, experience were also equally relevant.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Based on these findings, I decided to add social features where users
          can read blog posts or reply to question from other users. This
          feature will contribute to the consistent traffic, opportunity to
          build the trust and to preview the app for potential users.
        </p>
        <p>
          Next to portray my target users I created 2 user personas. Alongside,
          I also created a mental model and user journeys for the personas, so
          that the user audience could be at the forefront of my mind during
          design process.

          Using the user personas and their user journeys, I created user flows
          for 3 main features of the app. It helped me to discover and layout
          the pages and screens that my personas needed in order to meet their
          goals.

          This step was furthered sharpened and refined using sitemap and card
          sorting.
        </p>
        <p>
          Card sorting helped me structure the information within the app and
          pushed me to think further from the users point of view and their
          expectations. To adjust to these findings I refined the sitemap and
          combined search and find options as one. As the primary function of
          the app is to find an expert, I paid extra attention to make sure that
          search was accessible from all the pages and was easier for users to
          find it. Topics like favorites, ask a question, review and delete
          account were relatively hard to sort out due to varying opinions and
          smaller group of participants.

      <div class="sectiontext">
        <p>
          Now that I had laid my foundations on organizing information in my
          app. It was time to sketch out the initial ideas by creating low
          fidelity wireframes. With every transition from low to mid fidelity
          (Balsamiq) and then to High Fidelity (Adobe Xd), I was able adjust and
          update my design to improve usability. First versions of high fidelity
          prototype was used to conduct user testing.
        </p>
        <p>
          Users were required to search and book an expert and leave a review
          for their past appointments.

      </div>
      <div class="sectiontext">
        <p>
          First version of high fidelity wireframes. This is the version I used
          for user testing. At this moment the wireframes were fairly basic and
          was lacking character style.
        </p>
      </div>
      <img class="imagefull" src="../img/projects/advizors/7.png" alt="" />

      <div class="sectiontext">
        <p>
          After the first version of high fidelity wireframes was ready it was
          time to conduct usability test test and collect feedbacks from the
          users. Before conducting the usability test I created a test plan and
          script and recruited 6 potential participants from various
          backgrounds. Participants loved the idea of having an expert app but
          at the same time found it hard to interact with the prototype as the
          pages were still basic. The major hurdle amongst the participants was
          to leave a review. Majority of the participants had problem performing
          this task. So this was major issue I focused on my next iterations.
        </p>
        <p>
          All the results were then analyzed using second round of affinity
          mapping. Followed by using rainbow spreadsheet to organise information
          and propose possible solutions.

        The Iterations happened in 2 phases.

      <div class="sectionheading">
        <p>Phase 1</p>
      </div>
      <div class="sectiontext">
        <p>
          Phase 1 was updating the wireframes after the user test and focused on
          improving design of 5 errors. Here my prime focus was to improve the
          layout of the pages and make it clean for the users. The major change
          at this phase was on the homepage and search. Iterations began with
          finalising the colors for app and updating the pages. For Advizors I
          choose blue and orange colour scheme. Orange colour normally
          represents enthusiasm, encouragement and happiness while blue
          represents stability, tranquility, trust which is the feelings I
          wanted to evoke in our users when they see and use the app. I also
          conducted preference testing with 2 versions of introduction page.
        </p>
        <p>
          Phase 2 of iterations was done after design collaboration.

        <p>Preference Testing</p>
      </div>

      <img class="imagefulllong" src="../img/projects/advizors/9.png" alt="" />

      <p class="sectiontext">
        13 participants replied to the preference test I sent out. Main
        differences between 2 screens was with the placement of the background
        image. 86% (12 participants) preferred version 1 and only 7% (1
        participant) version 2. Participants mentioned that the background
        picture made the page easier to relate and represented the app. I
        further polished the design by updating the picture and layout of the
        page. The new picture represents our users and the story app is trying
        to convey.

      <div class="sectionheading">
        <p>Refine and Present</p>

      <div class="sectiontext">
        <p>
          Phase 2
        </p>
        <p>
          This phase began with polishing the pages using visual design
          principles and grids to improve UX, UI and overall usability of your
          app. I also collaborated with other CareerFoundry UX students to
          collect peer feedbacks on my design. Most of the comments were
          positive and participants liked the UX, pictures, illustrations. I had
          used a darker shade of orange for this testing and it was pointed out
          that dark orange strikes out as red and represents error which is not
          the best option for this app.
