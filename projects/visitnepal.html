        Concept Background

      <div class="sectiontext">
        <p>
          This year, Nepal has launched a tourism campaign ‘Visit Nepal Year
          2020’ with a theme of “Lifetime Experiences”. The government plans to
          welcome 2 million international tourists by the end of 2020. Nepal has
          also been named a ‘top destination for travellers to visit in 2020 and
          beyond’ by Forbes magazine-><a
            href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/katherineparkermagyar/2019/12/11/2020-travel-goals-10-bucket-list-trips-for-the-next-decade/#289685505f9d"

          >
          <br />
          I was thrilled to find out about the launch of 2020 campaign and
          believe it is a perfect opportunity to get more tourists and to
          promote local businesses. But with quick research, I was disappointed
          with the lack of promotion and information available in internet about
          the campaign and overall tourism in Nepal.
          <br />
          I saw an opportunity here to develop a travel app which
          provides travellers with all the information they require for a
          perfect trip to Nepal and help make 2020 campaign successful. At the
          same time it could also help locals to connect and promote their
          services with the tourists.
          <br />
          I worked on this concept project from start to end that is from design
          to prototype. Below is the case study on how I listened
          to users problems and designed the app.

          This will be mobile first design app as there are only few outdated
          and mundane apps about Nepal with very limited offerings. Design
          inspiration of this app came from wanting to create an app for
          tourists and locals which was professional and inviting. With VISIT
          NEPAL focus was to create a clean, trustworthy and user
          friendly application. Rather than creating an app that feels
          monotonous, I have regarded the best way to navigate and filter
          content on mobile devices by conducting end-to-end research and design
          process, from surveying both Nepalese people and non-Nepalese people
          to validating design decisions by usability testing with target users.
          My design evolved through several rounds of iteration at different
          stages.

          Research began with competitor analysis followed by interviews with 10
          participants and then creating affinity mapping to derive feedbacks
          and deep insights on potential features, opportunities, user’s
          behaviours and pain points. This step provided me with the strong
          foundation for my app.

            skyscanner, Guides by lonely planet and culture trip to gather
            inspirations. Through this analysis I derived that the existing apps

          Visit Nepal.
          <br />
          Instead of creating individual user journeys, I created one map that

              In booking page I added more options to choose language, add
              people of various age group and status and changed notes to
              Request to make it clear that users can write their special
              request to tour company.

            <br />
            <dt>
              I also changed the options bar into boxes To give the app
              consistent flow and to make it easier for user to click on the
              options.

            One of the main feature I added after testing was to connect with
            the local and enjoy experiences with them. Users can choose from
            experience they want and also view the profile before booking the
            local.
          </dt>
          <br />

            The app is far from complete and needs more tests and updates which
            I will continue to work on.
